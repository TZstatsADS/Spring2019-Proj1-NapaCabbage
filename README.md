### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Statistical Analysis for Marriage in HappyDB
+ This project is conducted by [Zongbo Cai]

+ Project summary: HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments. There are many interesting phenomena that can be revealed by the data in this database. Many people say that marriage is the grave of love. Does marriage have impact on people's feelings, especially on happy things? What do people do before and after marriage? This project analyzed the data and answered these questions.
